<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'am a UX researcher with an academic background in human-computer interaction. My approach is mixed-methods: I chose the right mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to answer the research question at hand. My passion is to provide organisations with sound data to steer product development and base descisions on.</p>

<p>On this site, I share parts of my work I'm especially proud of and can share publicly.</p>
